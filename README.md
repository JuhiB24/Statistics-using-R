# Statistics-using-R
Statistics: we need a robust way to make a decision and come to a conclusion in an unbiased manner. It can be achieved by analyzing, interpreting, and presenting the data using statistical tools and methods. It is difficult to come to conclusions because when there is a lot of data, we cannot trust our own instincts because our biases creep in.
