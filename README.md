# Statistics-using-R
Statistics: we need a robust way to make a decision and come to a conclusion in an unbiased manner. It can be achieved by analyzing, interpreting, and presenting the data using statistical tools and methods. It is difficult to come to conclusions because when there is a lot of data, we cannot trust our own instincts because our biases creep in. 
◦ Performed multiple linear regression, logistic regression, and linear mixed-effects models (LMM) to analyze fixed and
random effects in longitudinal data (e.g., orthodontic growth patterns)
◦ Implemented bootstrapping resampling method to estimate confidence intervals and standard errors for model
parameters
◦ Conducted hypothesis testing using Chi-square, t-tests, ANOVA, and post-hoc analyses on biological and clinical datasets
(e.g., cancer Chernobyl Belarus, Mess Bill, nettle 1999 climate, Sleep and lifestyle, student data, trait placebo, etc.)
◦ Developed statistical analysis workflows in R for data cleaning, assumption checking, model selection (AIC, stepwise
regression), and visualization using ggplot2 and easystats
